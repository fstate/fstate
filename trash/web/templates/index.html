        <p>Dear colleagues, we are happy to greet you at the &beta;-test of  <strong>fstate</strong> project, which allow to find decays by the final state.</p>
        <p>At this moment you can try to search decays with up to {{ max_decay_chain }} particles in the final state (try pi+ pi- mu+ mu-, for example).</p>
        <p>We keep only cascades of decays, which branching is higher than {{ br_cutoff }}. Decay chains with lower final branching fraction are skipped since they are unlikely to be observed with current experimental facilities.</p>
        <p><strong>If you see some decays or particles missing, please add them <a href="/add-physics">here</a>! Added information will be checked by experts and will appear in database soon after.</strong></p>
        <p>If you have some comments or see a bug, we would appreciate if you could <a href="mailto:ilya.komarov@epfl.ch,a.baranov@cern.ch?Subject=fstate%20feedback">
          write</a> us about it.</p>
